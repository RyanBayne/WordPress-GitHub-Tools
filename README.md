# WordPress-GitHub-Tools
WordPress to GitHub and GitHub to WordPress sync plugin that can be extended with custom add-ons. There are already solutions that do just that but I need something on another level that allows me to sync multiple plugins to specific branches on multiple repositories. 

This is due to the complexity of the WordPress projects that I'm involved in - you'll see!
